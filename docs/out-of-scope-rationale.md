# Out of Scope Items - Detailed Rationale

This document explains why certain checklist items are categorized as "out of scope" for automated platform readiness checking and porting.

---

## Guiding Principles for "Out of Scope" Classification

An item is considered out of scope if it meets one or more of these criteria:

1. **Business Decision Required** - Requires stakeholder input, budget approval, or strategic planning
2. **Runtime Analysis Needed** - Cannot be determined from static code analysis alone
3. **Manual Testing Required** - Needs live environment testing, load testing, or observability
4. **Architectural Decision** - Fundamental design choice that affects entire application structure
5. **Infrastructure Provisioning** - Requires creating cloud resources beyond the application code
6. **Operational Process** - Ongoing management task, not a one-time configuration
7. **Requires Domain Knowledge** - Needs understanding of business logic, SLAs, or compliance requirements
8. **Over-Engineering Risk** - Automating this could make wrong assumptions and create more problems

## Cloudflare Workers - Out of Scope Items (8 items)

### 38. ⛔ CPU Time Optimization
**Why Out of Scope:**
- **Requires Runtime Analysis** - CPU usage depends on actual request patterns and data
- **Manual Code Review** - Identifying bottlenecks requires profiling and performance analysis
- **Architectural Decision** - May require redesigning algorithms or splitting work

**Example Issues:**
- Inefficient loops processing large datasets
- Synchronous operations that could be parallelized
- Heavy computation in request handlers

**Why We Can't Automate:**
- Static code analysis can't predict runtime CPU usage
- Optimization strategies vary wildly by use case
- Could introduce bugs by modifying algorithm logic
- Requires understanding business requirements (e.g., is real-time processing mandatory?)

**What We CAN Do:**
- Warn if code patterns suggest high CPU usage (nested loops, large iterations)
- Provide general optimization guidelines
- Recommend profiling tools

---

### 39. ⛔ Bundle Size Optimization
**Why Out of Scope:**
- **Build Configuration Dependency** - Requires understanding entire build pipeline
- **Requires Trade-offs** - Smaller bundle vs developer experience vs features
- **Tooling Complexity** - Tree-shaking, code-splitting, minification config

**Example Issues:**
- Large dependencies (moment.js, lodash) inflating bundle
- Unused code not being tree-shaken
- No code-splitting strategy

**Why We Can't Automate:**
- Can't determine which dependencies are actually needed vs "nice to have"
- Build optimization requires testing to ensure functionality isn't broken
- Different bundlers (webpack, esbuild, rollup) have different configurations
- Risk of breaking the application with aggressive optimization

**What We CAN Do:**
- Detect bundle size exceeds limit
- Identify large dependencies (suggest alternatives like date-fns vs moment)
- Recommend bundle analysis tools
- Provide general webpack/vite optimization config examples

---

### 40. ⛔ Subrequest Architecture Redesign
**Why Out of Scope:**
- **Architectural Decision** - Fundamental application design
- **Runtime Analysis Needed** - Can't predict actual subrequest count from code
- **Business Logic Dependency** - Subrequests may be essential to business requirements

**Example Issues:**
- Making 1 API call per item in a 2000-item list (2000 subrequests)
- Recursive fetches without proper batching
- Fan-out calls to microservices

**Why We Can't Automate:**
- Static analysis can't determine runtime subrequest count (depends on data)
- Redesigning data flow requires understanding business logic
- Batching strategies vary by external API constraints
- May require changes to backend services, not just the Worker

**What We CAN Do:**
- Detect patterns that could cause high subrequest counts (loops with fetch)
- Suggest batching patterns
- Warn about potential issues
- Provide architectural guidance for service-to-service communication

---

### 41. ⛔ Service Bindings Architecture
**Why Out of Scope:**
- **Architectural Decision** - Microservices vs monolith strategy
- **Business Requirements** - Team structure, deployment independence
- **Infrastructure Complexity** - Requires multiple Workers and orchestration

**Example Decisions:**
- Should we split auth logic into a separate Worker?
- Should API gateway be a separate Worker with service bindings?
- How to handle shared code between Workers?

**Why We Can't Automate:**
- No way to programmatically determine optimal service boundaries
- Depends on team size, deployment frequency, scaling needs
- Requires understanding of domain-driven design
- Over-splitting can create distributed system complexity

**What We CAN Do:**
- Detect if code is already modular (could benefit from splitting)
- Provide service binding configuration examples
- Recommend patterns for common use cases (API gateway, auth service)

---

### 42. ⛔ Static Asset Bundling
**Why Out of Scope:**
- **Build Tool Configuration** - Varies by framework (Vite, webpack, Next.js)
- **Performance Trade-offs** - Bundle size vs HTTP requests vs caching
- **Framework-Specific** - Each framework has different best practices

**Example Issues:**
- No asset versioning/cache-busting
- Images not optimized
- CSS/JS not minified
- No lazy loading for code chunks

**Why We Can't Automate:**
- Build configuration is highly project-specific
- Could break existing working builds
- Different frameworks handle assets differently
- Optimization strategy depends on asset types and usage patterns

**What We CAN Do:**
- Detect build tool in use
- Provide framework-specific optimization guides
- Suggest asset optimization tools (sharp for images, terser for JS)

---

### 43. ⛔ Cache API Implementation
**Why Out of Scope:**
- **Business Logic Dependency** - What to cache depends on application semantics
- **TTL Strategy** - Cache invalidation is notoriously difficult
- **Correctness Risk** - Incorrect caching can serve stale data

**Example Decisions:**
- Which endpoints should be cached?
- What are appropriate TTLs (time-to-live)?
- How to handle cache invalidation on updates?
- What cache keys to use?

**Why We Can't Automate:**
- Can't determine what data is safe to cache (user-specific vs public)
- TTL depends on data change frequency (unknown without domain knowledge)
- Cache invalidation strategy requires understanding business rules
- Wrong caching can cause data inconsistency bugs

**What We CAN Do:**
- Detect patterns that would benefit from caching (GET endpoints)
- Provide Cache API code examples
- Suggest common caching strategies (cache-aside, read-through)
- Warn about potential caching pitfalls
